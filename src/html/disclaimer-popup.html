				<p>The protocol is an open-source, blockchain-based software tool made available by the Chainspot Labs that seeks to provide an ability to top up wallets with zero coin balance in many chains.
				Your use of the Protocol is entirely at your own risk.</p>

				<p>The Protocol is available on an “as is” basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>

				<p>You assume all risks associated with using the Protocol, and digital assets and decentralized systems generally, including but not limited to, that:</p>

				<p>(a) digital assets and decentralized systems are highly volatile;</p>

				<p>(b) using digital assets and decentralized systems is inherently risky due to both features of such assets and decentralized systems and the potential unauthorized acts of third parties;</p>

				<p>(c) you may not have ready access to digital assets and decentralized systems; and</p>

				<p>(d) you may lose some or all of your tokens or other digital assets. You agree that you will have no recourse against anyone else, including the Chainspot or any entities related to the Protocol, for any losses due to the use of the Protocol. For example, these losses may arise from or relate to:</p>

				<p>(i) incorrect information;</p>

				<p>(ii) software or network failures;</p>

				<p>(iii) corrupted digital wallet files;</p>

				<p>(iv) unauthorized access;</p>

				<p>(v) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies;</p>

				<p>(vi) third-party activities; or</p>

				<p>(vii) revocation of your access to the Protocol.</p>
